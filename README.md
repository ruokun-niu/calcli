**A todo list that lives in your command line :smile:**

## What is calcli
Calcli is a minimalistic todo list that you can interact with through command line. You can add items, mark items as complete, or view the listed items through your terminal. It can be simply installed through `brew`, does not require internet access and completely safe (no data is uploaded; everything is stored locally).

Nowadays, todo lists are widely used as a tool for boosting productivity. Some prefer to achieve this digitally using apps/websites such as Google Calendar or Notion. While others may prefer a more traditional approach that invovles a pen and a stack of sticky notes.

As a software developer (shhh I only did a few internships but that still counts right) and CS student, I interact with the command line extensively throughout the day. I have used todo lists through out my undergraduate studies, but I sometimes found them to be counter-productive. For instance, let's say I'm coding and I want to add something to my todo list on Google Calendar. I need to switch to Chrome, open/switch a new tab, type calendar.go..... and then navigate the todo list and add/delete items as needed. What if I can do everything just in the command line? I don't have to switch a browser and navigate to Google calendar (or Youtube if I'm bored/distracted); rather, I can simply modify my todo list and jump straight back to work. This was the starting point of calcli.

## To use
Haven't implemented this part yet. Probably through something like `brew install calcli` lol
